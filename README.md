# arduino.speedometer
I realized for the computer architecture exam e fully functonal arduino speedometer.
I made the whole project in italian for bc my university is fully italian.

I simulated the application on Wokwi, in the .pdf there's the completely explaination of the project.

The assignment was to avoid using the base library arduino function, using timer and external interrupt and have direct access to register.

If you want more info about the project please contact me on:
